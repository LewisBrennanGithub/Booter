Booter - 1.1

Premise

Booter is an app designed to allow people to organise games of football with other players at a desired level of skill and seriousness with which they take the game. This happens by players rating themselves and then rating other players whom they've played with. When players create games they can set guideline levels but there will also be an actual level displayed which is calculated from the accumulated ratings of other players in the game.

This idea was born out of a desire from myself to find other players who don't rate themselves too highly on ability and just want to play for fun. My hope is that I can launch the app and find this, but also any other number of combinations can take place, for example players who rate themselves highly and want competitive games can also organise, with everything in between being possible as-well.

The app has been primarily designed for use on IOS phones however in time I'd like to expand this to web browsers and Android.
